HTML5-Photoshop-Sprite-Sheet-Creator
====================================

**Updated version**

In the previous version, the Sprite Sheet was created in the same Document and a CTRL+Z didn't undo the changes. All previous modifications, that were not saved, were lost. This updated version duplicates the current Document and creates the Sprite Sheet within the new Document.

**Based on William Malone's Sprite Sheet Creator**
